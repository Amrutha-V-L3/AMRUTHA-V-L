Weather forecasting is the process of estimating the conditions for a given location and time. Weather data and algorithms can be used to anticipate the weather for the next n days. Weather forecasting in data science is an application of time-series forecasting, in which predictions are made for a specific time using time-series data and algorithms. We want a dataset with historical weather data based on a certain area in order to forecast the weather using Python. On Kaggle, I discovered a dataset derived from New Delhi's daily meteorological data. This dataset can be used to forecast the weather.
